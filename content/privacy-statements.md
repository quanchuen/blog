Personally I hate trackers as much as you do, but since the site served by the Cloudflare Inc., you should at least read the "End Users" chapter on their [privacy policy](https://www.cloudflare.com/privacypolicy/).

## Scope

This privacy statement explains how and what information is collected, processed, used and disclosed for visitors like you.

## Data and Server Logs

The software that supports this site is [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) with [ed](https://github.com/sergeyklay/gohugo-theme-ed) template on a Cloudflare Pages, it preserves access logs with following:

- Date and time of access 
- IP address
- Url
- User-Agent

The IP addresses received by WriteFreely is a CloudFlare connecting IP, which isn't visitor's.

## Data Handling

Personal Identifiable Information(PII) is the kind of information that can be traced back to a person. This normally includes the name, email address, or phone number. 

IP and which webpages were viewed by someone can hardly be PII, but there are still arguments. Aside from these, I do not collect or store your personal information. Also, unless you are accessing this site bypassing the CDN, I do not know the exact IP address of yours.

## Third parties

It is possible that within this site, content from third parties such as YouTube videos, PDF documents from or graphics are integrated from other websites. These third parties may obtain your IP address. I have no control over the use of your information by the third-party.

I will try to ensure that only reputable and privacy-aware providers are the only ones that are linked, however, I have no control over their use of your information.

## Cookies

Cookies are the small chunks of files stored in your browser, they are essential to maintain sessions of visits and often claimed to "improve" the usability. The main purpose of them is, however, serve to capture statistical data about your visit and then to be analyzed.

IF you are simply viewing this site, the only cookie entry you are supposed to have is the `__cfduid`. Cloudflare claims this cookie is not PII and costs a huge fortune to remove.[0]
