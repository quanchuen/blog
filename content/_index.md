# Hi.

My Name Quan "Chuen" Zhou.

I push the limits of Linux systems, seek elegant and simple solutions for problems.

I am writing about small bits of networking, Linux, programming, and automation. Even though most of the staff might be already covered elsewhere.

## Current status

I had several other blogs before, somehow they didn't last long, but I still have backup files in the corners of my mailbox.  So it is possible that you see some of the articles predates the registration of this domain name.

I'm trying to keep everything consistent in one place. So I'll keep *this* site up and running as long as I could.

## Contact

Until I have figured out how to connect a hugo site to Mastodon, if you want to make comments, please drop a mail at hi [at] qzhou.dev.
